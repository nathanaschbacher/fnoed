# Overview

fnoed is a node.js client to [fnordmetric](https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric/) with a simple, effective interface. 

    var Fnoed = require('fnoed');
    var metrics = new Fnoed();
    
    metrics.send('my_event');
    metrics.send({ _type: 'another_event', extra_stuff: 'additional event details'});
    metrics.send('my_event', true, function(err, res) {
        metrics.close();
    });

It allows you to easily send metric events directly to the redis backing of your fnordmetric installation.  The events are in

# Installation

    $ npm install fnoed

If you haven't already installed fnordmetric then do so:

    $ gem install fnordmetric

# Examples

In the `examples/` directory of the repository you'll find both an example fnordmetric startup script which you can use like this:

    $ cd fnoed/examples
    $ ruby example_fnord.rb run

and also an example node.js program that will send events using fnoed to the above running fnordmetric instance like this:

    $ cd fnoed/examples
    $ node example_fnoed.js

# API

### new Fnoed( _options_ )

If _options_ isn't passed in then the defaults used to will be:

    options = { host: 'localhost',
                port: 6379,
                event_queue_ttl: 60 };

`host` is the location of the fnordmetric redis backend that your installation is using.

`port` is the port that the fnordmetric redis backend is running on.

`event_queue_ttl` is the fnordmetric timeout/expiration for processing new event entries.

You may also include any [node_redis options](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/#rediscreateclientport-host-options) you like and they'll be passed right along to the underling redis client. 

### .send( _event_ , [_keepalive_, [__return_] ] )

This method is for sending events to your fnordmetric redis backend.

`event` can be either a simple string of an event name defined in fnordmetric, like `.send('my_event');` or a full event object `.send({ _type: 'my_event', foo: 'additional info', bar: 'even more still'});`

`keepalive` **( optional, default: false )** tells fnoed whether or not to close the connection after it's done sending an event.  If you have to send a lot of events in rapid succession, then you can set this to true and keep the connection open to cut down on the resources required to reconnect to redis with each new event sent.  However, you'll have to later manage manually closing the connection using the `.close()` method to keep orphaned connections from piling up.

`_return` **( optional, default: function(){} )** is a callback expecting a `err, res` signature that can be used to catch errors, validate that sending an event completed, or perform some cleanup like closing the connection.

### .close()

This is essentially a convenience wrapper around the redis client's .end() method.  If you have told your .send() method to "keepalive", then at some point you'll have to manually close your connection to keep orphaned connections from piling up.
